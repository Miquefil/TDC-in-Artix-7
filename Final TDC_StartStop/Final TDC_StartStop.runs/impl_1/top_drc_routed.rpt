2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oFall is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oFall_INST_0/O, cell u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oFall_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oRise is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oRise_INST_0/O, cell u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oRise_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oFall_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u_tdc/u_merge/enable_counter_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u_tdc/u_EdgeDetector/oRise_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u_tdc/u_merge/storeStart_reg
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
16 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are u_tdc/u_Coarse_0/stored[15:0].
Related violations: <none>
