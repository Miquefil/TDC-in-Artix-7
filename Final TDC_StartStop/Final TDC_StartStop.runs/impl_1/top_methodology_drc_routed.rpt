There is a large setup violation of -3.670 ns between u_fine_debug/counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out2_block_clock_clk_wiz_0_0) and u_tdc/u_Coarse_1/count_reg[7]/CE (clocked by clk_out3_block_clock_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
